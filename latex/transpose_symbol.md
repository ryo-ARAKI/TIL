# 行列，ベクトルの転置（transpose）をどう表記するか？

- `\intercal` 記号がよい

```latex
\usepackage{amssymb}
\vb*{v}^\intercal
```

- 参考：[What is the best symbol for vector/matrix transpose?](https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/30619)
  - > I would recommend the `\intercal` symbol to produce a "T" which isn't so big.
  - > Some people use a superscripted \intercal for matrix transpose: A^\intercal. (See the May 2009 comp.text.tex thread, "raising math symbols", for suggestions about altering the height of the superscript.) \top, T, and \mathsf{T} are other popular choices.
